# ed success
 
just a lil project where we try to find if education impacts the success of a community, whatever that is

credits are already in our [main file](src/main.rmd) but here's the data sources anyways:

* [unemployment data](https://www.bls.gov/lau/)
* [basically everything else](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=county_complete)
* [crime data](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017)
* [FIPS table & stuff](https://github.com/kjhealy/fips-codes/blob/master/state_and_county_fips_master.csv)

if you want to cringe at our slideshow that we did you can view it
